Generate correct message from Old Button Phone Keypad Inputs.

## Problem Description

Here is an old phone keypad with alphabetical letters, a
backspace key, and a send button.

Each button has a number to identify it and pressing a button
multiple times will cycle through the letters on it allowing
each button to represent more than one letter.

For example, pressing 2 once will return ‘A’ but pressing twice in succession will return
‘B’.

You must pause for a second in order to type two characters from the same
button

after each other: “222 2 22” -> “CAB”.
